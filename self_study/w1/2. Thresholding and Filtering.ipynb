    "Thresholding and filtering are fundamental concepts in the field of computer vision, playing a crucial role in image processing and analysis. Thresholding is segmenting an image into distinct regions based on pixel intensity values. This method is commonly used to separate objects of interest from their background. However, presence of noise or details that we are not interested in can hinder thresholding performance. We can use filtering to overcome this problem. Filtering, is used to enhance or suppress certain features within an image by applying various convolution operations. As you know, convolutions form the basis of CNNs. In this notebook we will first explore thresholding and then see how filtering can help improve thresholding performance. In the previous notebook you have already seen thresholding, but as you will see there is much more to it.\n",
