    "## Moving the Pipette to the Corners of the Working Envelope\n",
    "\n",
    "The code snippet below moves the pipette to all 8 corners of its working envelope.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. The working envelope is defined based on the robot's operational range, with corners generated by combining minimum and maximum values of X, Y, and Z coordinates.\n",
    "2. The 8 corners of the envelope are calculated as combinations of the predefined X, Y, and Z values.\n",
    "3. For each corner:\n",
    "   - The pipette is commanded to move to the specified X, Y, Z coordinates, with no drop action (drop command = 0).\n",
    "   - The simulation runs for 100 steps to allow the pipette to reach the target position.\n",
    "   - The pipette's state is logged after reaching the corner for verification purposes.\n",
    "4. After all corners have been visited, the simulation is closed.\n"
